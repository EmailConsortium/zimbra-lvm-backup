=================

Script to backup Zimbra on a dedicated LVM logical volumn.

This script has been improved from the old one discussed on Zimbra community to have abilities to run scheduled backup as a cronjob, remove old backups and add some more parameters as well.
One of cool things is the system downtime should be less than a minute; recommended to use in production environments.
